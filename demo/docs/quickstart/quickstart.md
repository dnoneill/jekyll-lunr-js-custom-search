The jekyll-lunr-js-custom-search gem creates a prebuilt lunr index for a Jekyll site. A prebuilt JavaScript plugin allows you to create and display a search. 

In this quickstart guide you will find step by step instructions for installing the gem. 

If you don't want to use the gem but only the JavaScript plugin, you have to configure the settings for the page manually. Widgets are only used in the Ruby plugin. All the other steps still need to be executed for the script to work. 

This is the code for the plugin and the CSS:
* [custom-search.js](https://dnoneill.github.io/jekyll-lunr-js-custom-search/dist/custom-search.js)
* [custom-search.css](https://dnoneill.github.io/jekyll-lunr-js-custom-search/dist/custom-search.css)
